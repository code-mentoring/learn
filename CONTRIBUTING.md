## üîß What can I work on?

We use Github to track our issues. Look for any issues labelled `help wanted`. If
there is nobody assigned, comment that you'd like to take it over, and a maintainer
will assign you.

You can view [all issues needing help here](https://github.com/code-mentoring/learn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## üí¨ Communication

We use our Slack community (`#project-cm` channel) for discussions on the project,
and Github projects for tracking issues.

We also have a **weekly standup call at 6pm EST** on Hangouts. Message one of the
maintainers for access to slack or to get a meeting invite.

## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sprints

We do monthly sprints with weekly standups at 6pm EST on hangouts. This means
each month we deploy to master with all the PRs that were done that month.

## üå≥ Branches

We use the [Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) branching
strategy to maintain the project. **PLEASE FOLLOW THIS FORMAT**

- `master` Production branch. Limited access on who can deploy to this
- `develop` Main development branch. We merge `feature/*` PRs into this branch
  once they're approved
- `feature/*` A feature branch aimed at addressing a SINGLE feature/fix. We try
  to keep these as SMALL AS POSSIBLE so our PR reviews are not to challenging. If
  a maintainer asks you to reduce your PR size, please do so.
- `release/vX.X.X` Used to release the sprints work into production.

## Commit Messages

### Message Structure

A commit message consists of three distinct parts separated by a blank line: the title, an **optional** body and an **optional** footer but we'll be focusing only on the subject. The layout looks like this:

`type(scope?): subject`

The title consists of the type of the message and subject.

### :exclamation: Command Line

This is how you commit your message with all three parts with a blank line:

`git commit -m "type(scope)?: subject"

### The Type

The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:

- **feat**: a new feature
- **fix**: a bug fix
- **docs**: changes to documentation
- **style**: formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
- **refactor**: refactoring production code
- **test**: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- **chore**: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

### The Scope

The scope describes the category of your change and the commonly used are of the following:

- build,
- chore,
- ci,
- docs,
- feat,
- fix,
- perf,
- refactor,
- revert,
- style,
- test

NOTE: These strict type and scope can be found in **commitlint.config.js**

### The Subject

Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, does not begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.
Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.

## PRs

As per git flow, all PRs should be on branches with the names `feature/name-of-feature`.
**They should be requested to merge into the `develop` branch, NOT THE `master` branch.**

### Approaches to writing a PR

Include the purpose of this Pull Request. For example:

`This is a spike to explore‚Ä¶`

`This simplifies the display of‚Ä¶`

`This fixes handling of‚Ä¶`

Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with any relevant links); don‚Äôt assume familiarity with the history.

Be explicit about what feedback you want, a quick pair of :eyes: on the code, discussion on the technical approach, critique on design or a review of copy.

### Feature breaking

Whenever it‚Äôs possible, break pull requests into smaller ones.

Let‚Äôs say that you need to create a subscribe feature on your app. It's just a form that accepts an email address and saves it. Without knowing how your app works, I can already break it in 8 pull requests.

- Create a model to save emails
- Create a route to receive requests
- Create a controller
- Create a service to save it in the database (business logic)
- Create a policy to handle access control
- Create a subscribe component (frontend)
- Create a button to call the subscribe component
- Add the subscribe button in the interface

### Title

Make a self-explanatory title describing what the pull request does. (Issue reference can be put in the subject. EG: ci: fixes #44)

### Description

Detail with what was changed, why it was changed, and how it was changed.
If necessary, add some screenshots or a GIF or video of you using the feature.

When a PR is ready, please make sure to request a review from a üß¢ maintainer.
Once the maintainer has approved your PR, it will be merged for you into `develop`.

## Offering feedback

- Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why this Pull Request exists.
- If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding; think before you react.
- Ask, don‚Äôt tell. (‚ÄúWhat do you think about trying‚Ä¶?‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in line with the style guide? A personal preference?)
- Offer ways to simplify or improve code.
- Avoid using derogatory terms, like ‚Äústupid‚Äù, when referring to the work someone has produced.
- Be humble. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, let‚Äôs try‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Avoid hyperbole. (‚ÄúNEVER do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product quality, through group critique.
- Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive language as opposed to neutral?
- Use emoji to clarify tone. Compare ‚Äú:sparkles: :sparkles: Looks good :+1: :sparkles: :sparkles:‚Äù to ‚ÄúLooks good.‚Äù

## Responding to feedback

- Consider leading with an expression of appreciation, especially when feedback has been mixed.
- Ask for clarification. (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand, can you clarify?‚Äù)
- Offer clarification, explain the decisions you made to reach a solution in question.
- Try to respond to every comment.
- Link to any follow up commits or Pull Requests. (‚ÄúGood call! Done in 1682851‚Äù)
- If there is growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if the written word is still the best form of communication. Talk (virtually) face-to-face, then mutually consider posting a follow-up to summarize any offline discussion (useful for others who are following along, now or later).
- These guidelines were inspired partly by Thoughtbot‚Äôs [code review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review) guide.
