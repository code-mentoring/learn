# HTML and Cupcakes!

Hey **{{firstName}}!** I'm HTML Holly üëã. 
I'm a cook by day and a programmer by night.
As a fellow self-taught programmer, I'm so glad you're here.

## The Code Along Zine
I'm trying to organize this magazine to help people like us to learn how to code and I could really use some help with organizing all the content using HTML. Would you help me? 
Let's start reviewing what HTML is and its place within the web development...

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is the building blocks of web pages.
An HTML element is represented by a "tag". It has 3 elements: the opening tag, the content and the closing tag.

```html
<opening> content </closing>
```

This is *slightly* incorrect though, because in HTML, the ["opening tag"](#concept-html-opening-tag)
must match the ["closing tag"](#concept-html-closing-tag). It would look more like‚Ä¶


```html
<element> content </element>
```

Pretty easy right? Notice the `/`? This "closes" the element by creating a closing tag.

Note: Some elements are self-closing, so they will look more like this:

```html
<element />
```

## The 3 Pillars of Web Development!

All modern web pages have 3 main pillars as their foundation:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** => is the structure of the website, i.e. heading, title, text, images, buttons, etc.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)** => is the style, format we want the site to have, i.e. blue button, red text, white background color.

- **JavaScript** => is the logic, behavior we need the site to have, i.e. page changes when navigation bar is clicked, or submission of form when button send is clicked.

As you can see, all modern pages uses these 3 to create a beautiful and fluid experience to their user.

## Cupcakes: The Web Development Analogy

I love cupcakes üßÅ and I think that is a great analogy that helps me to remember what each pillar does.

- **HTML**: would be the ingredients of the cupcake, for instance the flour, eggs, sugar.
- **JavaScript**: would be the instructions, how to make the batter and bake the cupcake. 
- **CSS**: would be the decoration of the cupcake, the frosting and sprinkles!

## Roll Up The Sleeves and Let's Begin!

Now that we reviewed what HTML is and how it works, we need to find out which tags we can use to adjust the content of the Code Along Zine.

Let's go together on this journey and have lots of fun creating our Zine!
