## Headings and more Headings

Whenever we want to have a title or a subtitle on our application, we use headings. It's a pre-formatted text that is offered in 6 different sizes.
The bigger the number the smaller is the size. I.e. `h1` is the biggest one and `h6` is the smallest one.

```html
<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
```

## What about regular text?

For regular text within the application, we use the `paragraph` tag.

```html
<p>This is a p tag that helps us to add regular text!</p>
```

## A few other friends

HTML also offers us a few other tags to use with text.
- `<blockquote cite="add-source-here">...</blockquote>` => Use this tag when you want to quote another text, just like in the books, when they refer to other sources. This tag also gets a property of `cite`, so you can add the origin source.

- `<q>...</q>` => Use this tag for shorter quotes, usually one liner within the text. The browsers usually adds quotes around it.

- `<abbr title="add-name-here">...</abbr>` => Use this when you are going to use an abbreviation or acronym. I.e. when you use UN for United Nations.

- `<address>...</address>` => Like the name suggests, use for addresses. The browser usually adds a line break before and after it and the text show up as italic.

- `<cite>...</cite>` => Use when citing a creative work title. Note, not to be used for people's names, but for the artwork title. The text will also show up as italic.

- `<bdo dir="add-direction">...</bdo>` => This tag is used to override the current text direction. It stands for bi-directional override. i.e. "rtl" - text will show up from right to left.


```html
<p>Here is a quote from Code Mentoring website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://codementoring.co/">

Weâ€™re an international community of weekly meetups that provide free mentoring and coaching for developers.
</blockquote>

<p>And Hamlet said:<q>To be, or not to be? That is the question.</q></p>

<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>

<address>
Visit us:

<p><cite>Hamlet</cite> was written by William Shakespeare.</p>

<bdo dir="rtl">Text will show up from right to left.</bdo>
```
