## Think of a human

Let's begin with an example. When we think of a human being, we have:
- the bones, skeleton, basic structure => **HTML**
- the adjectives, layout, i.e straight hair, wavy hair, curly hair, bald => **CSS**
- the brain that controls the actions, behavior, i.e. walking, breathing => **JavaScript**

```html
HTML = 🦴
CSS = 👩🏻👩🏼‍🦱👩🏽‍🦰👨🏽👱🏻‍♂️👨🏾‍🦳👵🏿
JavaScript = 💃🏼🏃🏽🏊‍♂️🧘🏽‍♀️🧠
```

## In other words

- **HTML** - is the base, the structure of a website, it's the heading, text, images, buttons, etc.
- **CSS** - is the style, format you want the site to have, i.e. blue button, red text, grey background.
- **JavaScript** - is the logic, behavior you need for your site to work, i.e. submit form when I click the button, change page when I click the navigation bar.
