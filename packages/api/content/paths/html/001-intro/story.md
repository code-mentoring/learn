# Thinking inside the box

Hey **{{firstName}}!** I'm HTML Holly ðŸ‘‹. I'm so glad you're here.
We're having some problems with all our boxes... and we need your help!

---

## What is a *box*?
Before we get started, let's learn a bit about what HTML is. Maybe you've heard of it?

HTML is just a bunch of boxes! A container, something you can put things in, and carry around or store for later.
You can even put boxes inside other boxes!

```html
HTML = ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦'s
```

> A "box" in HTML is called an "element"

## How do we "make" a box (element)?

We can write elements in HTML with 3 parts.
The beginning, the middle and the end ðŸ˜ƒ. It looks like this.

```html
<beginning> middle </end>
```

This is *slightly* incorrect though, because in HTML, the ["opening tag"](#concept-html-opening-tag)
must match the ["closing tag"](#concept-html-closing-tag). It would look more likeâ€¦


```html
<element> content </element>
```

Pretty easy right? Notice the `/`? This "closes" the box by creating a closing tag. Anything that comes after it is "outside" the box. Cool, huh?

## Try it yourself!

Ok, time to jump into some code! Excited? Don't worry, I'm here to make it easy.

```html
<box> my stuff </box>
```

Write this below. Don't forget to close your element with the `/`!

[<box>\smy stuff\s<\\/box>](#writeCode)
