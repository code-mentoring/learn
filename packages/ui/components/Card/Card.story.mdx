# Card

## Properties
The `Card` uses the `Box` as a base, so you can pass the same properties as the `Box`. Other than that, the `Card` also has a background color of white, position relative, the theme's default border-radius (8px) and main shadow.

<Card>
  <Row>
    <Card>
      Content
    </Card>
  </Row>
</Card>

```tsx
<Card>...content...</Card>
```
